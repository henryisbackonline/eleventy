# Heading 1
This time, we've changed the directory for the layouts in `.eleventy.js`

What have we learned so far?

1. all starting files much go in `_src`. I Guess this can be changed too, but I'll have to look at it.
2. eleventy works with markdown beautifully.
3. I think i have to update some of the exmplate languages in the *config* file. I'll do that later.

Let's see if we can't reference an image. I'll put it it the image folder, which lives at the root of the source directory
