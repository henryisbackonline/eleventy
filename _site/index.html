<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<p>This time, we've changed the directory for the layouts in <code>.eleventy.js</code></p>
<p>What have we learned so far?</p>
<ol>
<li>all starting files much go in <code>_src</code>. I Guess this can be changed too, but I'll have to look at it.</li>
<li>eleventy works with markdown beautifully.</li>
<li>I think i have to update some of the exmplate languages in the <em>config</em> file. I'll do that later.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's see if we can't reference an image. I'll put it it the image folder, which lives at the root of the source directory</p>
